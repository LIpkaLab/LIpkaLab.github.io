# About the site

The [code for this site][0] was forked from The Neuroinformatics and Brain Connectiviy Lab, which was forked from Dr. Allan Drummond's lab website, which in turn took a great deal of inspiration from Dr. Travis Bedford's [lab website][1]. We have modified a lot of the code and added some fun features, but the core codebase is still largely taken from the Drummond lab's original repository. The code was openly shared on [GitHub][2] under the MIT license, so please feel free to adapt it for your own purposes. However, if you do use any of the code, please remember to cite the code to Dr. Drummond and to NBCLab to link back to their accounts [site][3].
