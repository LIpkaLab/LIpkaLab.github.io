The Lipka Lab is research lab based at the Department of [Crop Sciences](https://cropsciences.illinois.edu/) at the [University of Illinois Urbana Champaign](https://illinois.edu/), in Urbana, Illinois, led by Dr. [Alex Lipka](https://cropsciences.illinois.edu/directory/alipka). 

The Lipka Lab is located on the Turner Hall building (AHC-4 Room 380).

The research aim of this lab is to create statistical approaches to analyze quantitative genetics data. 

The Lipka Lab conducts state of the art statistical approaches to analyze quantitative genetics data. Specifically, the Lipka Lab has two main research objectives. First, we seek to develop and apply optimal statistical approaches for associating the genotype to the phenotype. In particular, we are interested in assessing ways to improve the statistical power and predictive ability of genome-wide association study and genomic selection models. Our second objective is to participate in interdisciplinary collaborations that seek to gain a further understanding in the biology underlying polygenic and complex traits and could ultimately result in increasing agronomical output and/or the quality of human life. Although our research has a focus on analyzing data from crops and plants, we are also open to collaborating with scientists working in animal sciences and human medicine.
